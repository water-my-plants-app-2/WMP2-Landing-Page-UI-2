#Project Title:

Water My Plants

#Motivation:

This Project was built along with 6 other developers as part of Lambda School's first ever Build week. We partnered with students from different cohorts to build a UI/FE/BE working program. Water My Plants was designed to help people who struggle with remembering when they need to water their plants.
